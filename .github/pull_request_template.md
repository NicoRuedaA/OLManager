## Checks run

Required/stable PR checks are intentionally lightweight and production-build-free:

- [ ] `frontend-install` passed (dependency installation validation).
- [ ] `rust-check` passed (`cargo fmt --check` and `cargo check`).
- [ ] Not applicable locally; docs/templates only.

Manual/experimental full checks are available for maintainer-requested validation and current debt tracking:

- `frontend-full-experimental` (`npm test`, `npm run build:types`).
- `rust-full-experimental` (`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace`).

Do not mark the experimental full checks as required for this PR unless a maintainer explicitly asks.
